# Our Ways of Working

The Azure Landing Zone team has the following regular ceremonies:

The ceremonies are hosted by the team members in rotation.

## Stand Up

Our stand-ups run in a Microsoft Teams meeting on Mondays and Thrusdays at 09:30 and last for fifteen minutes.

The host gets to decide the format, e.g. Walk the board, Yesterday/Today/Blockers, etc ...

Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays we do a text stand up where we follow the Yesterday/Today/Blockers format. This is to say, each team member posts an update to Microsoft Teams with what they did yesterday, what they will do today and any blockers.

## Backlog Refinement

The objective of this ceremony is to ensure that tasks are clearly defined and understood by the team. The tasks that meet these criteria are moved to the _ready to work_ backlog and prioritised and those that do not are kept in the backlog.

This is a 1 hour meeting meeting that takes place once a week, though we can have ad-hoc meetings if we run out of work to do.

The meeting is divided into two disctinct parts:

### 15 minutes Reading Time

This is a block of time designed to allow all team members to become familiar with the first 5 stories in the backlog.

### 45 minutes Meeting

This is the main part of the meeting, where the backlog refinement of the 5 first stories in the backlog takes place.

## Sprint Planning

The objective is to decide the sprint goal(s) and based on the goals set what stories should be in the sprint and in what order should they be done.

This is a 30 minute meeting that takes place once a fortnight.

Each Sprint is two weeks long and starts on a Wednesday.

## Sprint Retrospective

The objective of this ceremony is to review what worked and what did not work over the last sprint. Provide areas of improvement and kudos to team members.

Meeting to last 30 minutes and host can decide the format.

## Our Alliance

As a team, we regularly discuss and decide on our alliance. We document these openly and publicly.

- We agree that itâ€™s ok to disagree and challenge opinions.
- We agree that there are no stupid questions.
- We appreciate work takes time.
- We are respectful of others time.
- We code in the open.
- We have fun.
